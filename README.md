# Atk's dot files
*Always a work in progress*

Arch btw.

My preferred Sans Serif font is [Google's Product Sans](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-google-sans/), and for monospace I find myself using FiraCode Nerd Font for the ability to have both ligatures and emojis/symbols. Ordinarily I do just prefer Hack patched with ligatures.
